<b>Uniswap-Inspired Web3 Development Project<b>

<b>Overview<\b>

This project is a comprehensive Web3 development tutorial, where you'll build a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) inspired by Uniswap. You'll learn how to create a React application that integrates with MetaMask, fetches live smart contract data, and enables users to create, swap, and manage their own ERC20 tokens.

<b>Features<\b>

- MetaMask pairing for secure wallet integration
- Live smart contract data fetching and updating
- Creation of custom ERC20 tokens
- Swapping of tokens with other users
- User-friendly interface for managing tokens and transactions

<b>Technical Requirements<\b>

- React.js for frontend development
- Web3.js for blockchain interactions
- Solidity for smart contract development
- MetaMask for wallet integration
- Truffle Suite for smart contract deployment and testing

<b>Getting Started<\b>

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies with npm install
2. Set up your development environment with Truffle Suite and MetaMask
3. Follow the tutorial instructions to build and deploy your Uniswap-inspired DEX
